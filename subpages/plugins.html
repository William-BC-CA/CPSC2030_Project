                            You can have all players report the same ping, or only fake it for those having a specific IP/SteamID. This last feature is especially useful when running a dedicated server from your own computer, when you don't want people to guess you're an admin/owner by looking at your low ping.<br><a href = "../files/plugins/fakeping-pingfaker.zip">Direct Download</a></td>
