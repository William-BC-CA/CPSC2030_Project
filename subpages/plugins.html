                        <td><b>Game: Counter-Strike 1.6</b><br>This plugin can fake the display of a player's latency (ping) shown on the scoreboard. Unlike the "fakelag" command, it does not affect the player's real latency in any way.

                            You can have all players report the same ping, or only fake it for those having a specific IP/SteamID. This last feature is especially useful when running a dedicated server from your own computer, when you don't want people to guess you're an admin/owner by looking at your low ping.<br><a href = "../files/plugins/fakeping-pingfaker.zip">Direct Download</a></td>

                        <td><b>Game: Counter-Strike Source</b><br>I got the idea for this while posting my <a href = "http://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=1434455#post1434455">[CS:S] Give Cash</a> plugin.

                            This plugin ports over a feature from Killing Floor that allows players to give their cash to other players. This uses a menu rather then throwing the money on the ground however.
                            
                            Cvars control who the cash can be given to, and who the messages are shown to.<br><a href = "../files/plugins/GiftCash.smx">Direct Download</a>
